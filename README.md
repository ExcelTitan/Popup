# Popup - An Excel Add-in
A beautiful calendar widget for Excel

## What is it?
A beautiful and simple calendar widget that does all that you want it to, easily input dates into your spreadsheet.  
You can scroll quickly through the months with your mouse or choose the month and year from drop down menus.
It's super easy to use and easy to install.  

## How it Works
Open the form by clicking the button from the ribbon on the Home tab or the button in the context menu.
With the form open, you can click the arrows left and right to the previous or next month. You can also scroll the mouse wheel to scroll through the months really fast.
Clicking on 'Today' or the date at the bottom of the form will take you back to today's month and select today's date.

You can click on the month or year then choose from the drop downs provided.

A single click on date will input to the active cell, it's for this readon that the form is modal (you can't click on another cell once it's opened).
You can also double click on the Today label at the bottom to put today's date into the current cell.

## Source Material
Popup is an adaption of the date picker created by Trevor Eyre.  
This add-in has a lot of code added and and some modified code to suit the formatting that I prefer.  
Here is a link to Trevor's Date Picker which was v1.5.2 at time of writing:

If this fails here is a link to the workbook v1.5.2 CalendarForm.xlsx **put link in here**

The form's functionality is completed at this stage. Some work still remains to remove unnecessary code
